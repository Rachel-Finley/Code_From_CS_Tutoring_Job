This folder contains code that I worked on with a student to develop their skills in a variety
of different topics that we had covered over the course of a few sessions. I did my best to include
examples that solidified what we had learned so far, and how that may have interplay with 
the most current week's material at the time, which was reading, writing, and appending to files.

The code was written in collab and can be viewed with this link:
